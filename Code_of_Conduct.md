# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Git
* We will have a git tutorial prior to beginning the meat of the project (merging, branch creation).
* We want github issues (on projects) for specific parts of the project, separated in as small an issue as possible.

### Pairing
* Code review mornings and after lunch
* Work alone in the morning, pair after lunch

### Personal Space and Time
* Talk on slack if you're going to work on the project during any outside class time
* Outside of class hours, if you have paired on something you want to work on, give a detailed description that you'll be working on it
* Headphones means in work-mode, not rude-mode (only love)
* It's not mandatory to work outside of class
* Questions can be fielded during lunch or other appropriate times (i.e., during code wars)

### Disagreements, Feedback
* Constructive criticism
* Solve group methods (that may arise in some type of conflict) democratically
    - We think...
    - Compromise (if it's relevant)
* Don't take anything personally!
* Speak up for your needs, don't be too nice
    - Disagreements can be good! 
* Don't oppress the other group members depending on any personal issues that may arise
    - We want to be good friends to one another
    
### Health
* Take breaks as needed
* If you're sick, please get better! (Let us know so we're not mean and nagging you incessantly)

### Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project members individually. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
